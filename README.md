## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Traffic Trends Over Time

- **Observation:** Traffic peaked in **March** and **November**, likely due to marketing campaigns.
- **Trend:** Overall, there is **steady growth** with minor dips during off-peak periods.
- **Actionable Insight:** Plan campaigns around these peak months to maximize impact.

### Top Traffic Sources

- **Observation:** **Organic Search** consistently brings the highest number of users, indicating strong SEO performance.
- **Actionable Insight:** Invest further in SEO and content strategy. Consider cross-channel promotion to strengthen weaker sources.

| Channel         | User Volume | Sessions | Engagement Rate |
|-----------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Organic Search  | Highest    | Highest  | High            |
| Direct          | High       | High     | Highest         |
| Paid Search     | Low        | Low      | Low             |
| Social/Referral | Variable   | Moderate | Variable        |

### Engagement by Channel

- **Observation:** **Direct traffic** users show the highest average engagement time, suggesting strong brand loyalty or intent.
- **Actionable Insight:** Retargeting or email campaigns could help replicate this effect in other channels.

| Channel         | Avg. Engagement Time (s) | Engagement Rate |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Direct          | Highest                  | High            |
| Organic Search  | High                     | High            |
| Social/Referral | Variable                 | Variable        |
| Paid Search     | Low                      | Low             |

### Engagement Rate Variation

- **Observation:** **Social** and **Referral** sources demonstrate high variability in engagement. Some campaigns perform well, but consistency is lacking.
- **Actionable Insight:** Optimize content targeting and posting strategy on these platforms to improve consistency.

### Engaged vs. Non-Engaged Sessions

- **Observation:** **Organic Search** and **Email** channels have a higher share of engaged sessions.
- **Underperformers:** **Paid Search** lags in engagement, suggesting a need for better landing pages or audience segmentation.

| Channel         | Engaged Sessions Share | Recommendation                |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Organic Search  | High                  | Maintain SEO efforts          |
| Email           | High                  | Continue targeted campaigns   |
| Paid Search     | Low                   | Improve landing pages         |
| Referral/Social | Variable              | Refine targeting              |

### Traffic by Hour

- **Observation:** Most traffic from **Organic** and **Direct** channels peaks between **10 AM – 2 PM**.
- **Paid Search:** Shows more activity in the evening.
- **Actionable Insight:** Tailor ad and content scheduling to match these patterns for better performance.

### Traffic vs. Engagement Correlation

- **Observation:** There is a **weak/moderate correlation** between sessions and engagement rate.
- **Interpretation:** High traffic days do not always result in better engagement. Content relevance and precise targeting are crucial.

## Key Insights & Takeaways

- **Organic Search** is the top driver for both user volume and engagement.
- **Direct traffic** users are the most engaged, highlighting brand loyalty.
- **Social and Referral** channels are inconsistent—require better targeting and strategy.
- **User traffic patterns** vary by hour—timing content and campaigns can improve results.

---

## Conclusion

- **Channel Gaps Exist:** Each channel drives traffic and engagement differently.
- **Organic & Direct Win:** These channels deliver both high volume and quality engagement.
- **Quality Beats Quantity:** More sessions do not ensure strong engagement—content relevance is key.
- **Fix Underperformers:** Paid and Referral channels can improve with focused strategy, timing, and personalized content.
